<h2 class="chapter">1 Hamlib in a Nutshell</h2>

<p><a name="index-Nutshell-5"></a>

   <p>The <dfn>Ham Radio Control Libraries</dfn>, <dfn>Hamlib</dfn> for short, is a
development effort to provide a consistent interface for programmers
wanting to incorporate radio and rotator control in their programs.

   <p>Hamlib is not a complete user application, rather, it is a software
layer intended to make controlling various radios and other amateur
radio station (shack) hardware much easier.  Hamlib will allow authors
of software such as logging programs, digital communications programs,
or those wanting to develop the ultimate radio control software to
concentrate on the user interface and the basic function of the
program rather than radio control.  Hamlib consists of several parts,
the programming library, utility programs, and library interfaces to
other programming languages.

   <p>Most recent amateur radio transceivers allow external control of their
functions through a serial interface.  Unfortunately, control commands
are not always consistent across a manufacturer's product line and
each manufacturer's product line differs greatly from its competitors.

   <p>Hamlib attempts to solve this problem by presenting a "virtual radio"
to the programmer by providing an interface to actions such as setting
a given Variable Frequency Oscillator's (VFO) frequency, setting the
operating mode, querying the radio of its current status and settings,
and giving the application a list of a given radio's capabilities. 
Unfortunately, what can be accomplished by Hamlib is limited by the
radios themselves and some offer very limited capability.

   <p>Other devices, such as antenna rotators, can be placed into the Hamlib
control scheme.  Other recent developments include network interface
servers and a USB interface capability.  Language bindings are
provided for C, C++, Perl, Python, Lua and TCL (more to come).

<p><a name="Overview"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.1 A view from the top of the tower</h3>

<p><a name="index-Overview-6"></a>
<a name="index-Front-end-library-7"></a><a name="index-Virtual-radio-8"></a><a name="index-Virtual-rotator-9"></a>Hamlib is a <dfn>front end</dfn> library providing a <em>C</em> language
Application Programming Interface <acronym>API</acronym> to programmers wishing
to integrate radio or rotator control in their applications.  Hamlib
presents a <dfn>virtual radio</dfn> or <dfn>virtual rotator</dfn> that is a
consistent interface to an application despite wide differences in
radio and rotator interfaces and capabilities.

   <p><a name="index-Back-end-library-10"></a>The front end library uses a number of <dfn>back end</dfn> libraries to
translate from the front end to the various individual radio and
rotator models.  A back end library handles conversion of the front
end variables to the format needed by the radio or rotator device it
controls.  The back end libraries are generally grouped by
manufacturer and in some cases by a common control protocol.

Since a picture is worth quite a few words, here is a visual representation
of Hamlib's design.

</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-Scripting-languages-11"></a><a name="index-Languages_002c-scripting-12"></a><a name="index-Interface_002c-languages-13"></a>Hamlib also provides an interface library for each of several common
<dfn>scripting</dfn> languages such as <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>,
<a href="https://www.lua.org">Lua</a> and <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">TCL</a>.  These language <dfn>bindings</dfn> are generated through the use of
<a href="http://www.swig.org">SWIG</a> a parser/generator for multiple
language interfaces to a C library.  A native generated <em>C++</em>
language interface is also provided.

   <p><a name="index-Daemon_002c-network-14"></a><a name="index-Network_002c-daemon-15"></a>Besides the C and supplemental APIs, Hamlib also provides a pair of
network daemons that provide a text command based API for controlling
an attached radio or rotator through a <em>TCP/IP</em> network
connection.  The daemons then handle the interface to the Hamlib C
API.

   <p>More than one type of device, radio or rotator, may be controlled at a
time, however, there is generally a limit of one device per serial
port or other port.

<p><a name="The-Hamlib-project"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Hamlib project information</h3>

<p><a name="index-Hamlib-project-16"></a><a name="index-Project_002c-Hamlib-17"></a>
The Hamlib Project was founded by Frank Singleton,VK3FCS/KM5WS in July
2000.  Shortly after Stephane Fillod, F8CFE, joined Frank on the
Hamlib project and the API and implementation development led to a
reasonable level of maturity in a few years.  A major milestone was
reached when Hamlib 1.2.0 was released in March 2004.  The API and
Application Binary Interface (<acronym>ABI</acronym>) interfaces have remained
stable since that time up to the latest release of 3.2 in early 2018.

   <p>Development continues through the major version number 3.x and beyond. 
While some API tweaks are planned, ABI compatibility with the prior
1.2.<i>x</i> releases remains a priority.  Other goals include
streamlining the build system (done), improving the SWIG generated
language bindings (done), improving the overall documentation (this
manual, in progress), and other updates as warranted.

   <p>The Project is hosted by <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a> at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/">Hamlib project page</a>.  As <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> has become
a very popular project hosting site, Hamlib also has a dedicated
<a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib">GitHub project page</a>.  GitHub
also hosts the <a href="http://www.hamlib.org">hamlib.org</a> Web site and
the <a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/wiki">Hamlib Wiki</a>.

   <p>Development discussion and most user support take place on the
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hamlib/mailman/">hamlib-developer mailing list</a>.  While there are
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/hamlib/discussion/">SourceForge.net discussion forums</a>, they are rarely used and not as closely read by
the developers as the mailing list.

   <p>For <dfn>source code management</dfn>, the project uses
<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, a fast, distributed content tracker. 
Among its features is that every developer has the complete Hamlib
development history available locally.  For more information on using
Git, see <a href="#Working-with-Git">Working with Git</a>.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> While a canonical Git repository is hosted as SourceForge, its
availability is not essential to continued development, although
development work flows would change temporarily.  Several developers
find the GitHub Web interface easier to use and lately development has
centered around GitHub rather than SourceForge. 
</blockquote>

<p><a name="Applications-using-Hamlib"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.3 Applications using Hamlib</h3>

<p><a name="index-Hamlib-applications-18"></a><a name="index-Applications_002c-using-Hamlib-19"></a>
A number of application developers have taken advantage of Hamlib's
capabilities to implement radio and/or rotator control.  While not
exhaustive, a list is maintained at the Hamlib Wiki,
<a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/wiki/Applications-and-Screen-Shots">Applications/Screenshots</a>.  Developers are encouraged to request their
applications be added to the gallery by way of the hamlib-developer
mailing list.

<p><a name="Licensing-implications"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.4 Using Hamlib with your program</h3>

<p><a name="index-Hamlib-licensing-20"></a><a name="index-Licensing_002c-Hamlib-21"></a>
As with other Free Software projects, Hamlib relies heavily on
copyleft licensing to encourage development contributions and provide
an open atmosphere for development.  Hamlib's source code is released
under two licenses, the Lesser General Public License (<acronym>LGPL</acronym>)
for the library portion, and the General Public License
(<acronym>GPL</acronym>) for the utility programs.

   <p>The LGPL allows the library to be used (linked) by programs regardless
of their individual license.  However, any contributions to the
library source remain under copyleft which means that the library
source code may not be used in violation of the terms of the LGPL.

   <p>The utility program source files are released under the GPL.  Any direct
use of these sources must be in a form that complies with the terms of
the GPL.  Concepts learned by studying these sources for the purpose of
understanding the Hamlib API is not covered nor prohibited by the GPL,
however, directly copying GPL sources into any work that is incompatible
with the terms of the GPL is prohibited.

   <p>See <a href="#Copying-and-Redistribution">Copying and Redistribution</a>.

<p><a name="Radio-cloning"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.5 Radios with a clone capability</h3>

<p><a name="index-Radio-cloning-22"></a><a name="index-Cloning_002c-radio-23"></a>
Hamlib's focus is on controlling rigs that employ a port and command
protocol for setting frequency, mode, VFO, PTT, etc.  Most VHF/UHF
transceivers do not employ such control capability but do provide for
cloning the memory contents from radio to another of the same model. 
A related project, <a href="http://chirp.danplanet.com/">CHIRP</a>, aims to
support radios with such a clone capability.  Please contact the CHIRP
project for support of such radios.

<p><a name="Pronunciation"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.6 Pronouncing Hamlib</h3>

<p><a name="index-Pronouncing-Hamlib-24"></a><a name="index-Hamlib_002c-pronouncing-25"></a>
English speakers seem to have two alternate pronunciations for our
project:

     <ul>
<li>Hamlib (Ham - lib, long "i", as in library.) IPA style: /'ham læb/
<li>Hamlib (Ham - lib, short "i", as in liberty.) IPA style: /'ham lɪb/
</ul>

   <p>Then again, we have people who say Linux "L-eye-nux" and those who say
"L-in-nux"...

   <p>If you're French, the above does not apply! :-)

<!--  Chapter - -->
<p><a name="Getting-started"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">2 Getting started</h2>

<p>There are several ways to obtain a working installation of Hamlib. 
The following sections discuss installing from a package manager,
building from source, and installing Hamlib project supplied binaries
on Microsoft Windows&reg;.

<p><a name="Unix-binary-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Installing binary packages on Linux and BSD</h3>

<p><a name="index-Binary-packages_002c-Linux_002c-BSD-26"></a><a name="index-Linux-binary-packages-27"></a><a name="index-BSD-binary-packages-28"></a>
The easiest way to install a released version of Hamlib on a Linux
based distribution or a BSD variant is through the provided
<dfn>package manager</dfn>.  While package managers vary according to the
distribution (it's easy to lump BSD variants in this group too) their
end goal is to provide ready to use software packages.  Since such a
wide variety of package managers exist, it is best to recommend that
the documentation for your chosen distribution be your guide.

<p><a name="Source-options"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 A variety of Hamlib sources</h3>

<p><a name="index-Source-options-29"></a>
Distribution packages are most often official Hamlib releases and in
some cases could be quite old and lacking support for newer radios or
rotators.  In some cases support is improved in existing radio or
rotator back ends and bugs are fixed in newer releases.  Often times
to get the improved support/bug fixes, building from source will be
required.  Relax, it's not hard.  :-)

   <p>Source code is available as official releases, testing snapshots,
daily development snapshots, and the bleeding edge of development
directly from the <a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib">Git repository</a>.  As a rule, even the bleeding edge tarballs should
configure and compile without error even though certain implementation
work may be in progress and may be incomplete or have errors.

<p><a name="Source-releases"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Getting released source</h4>

<p><a name="index-Getting-released-source-30"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-getting-released-31"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-obtaining-releases-32"></a>
Official Hamlib source releases, commonly called <dfn>tarballs</dfn> can be
found on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/files/hamlib/">SourceForge.net Hamlib files</a> Web page.  As a convenience, release
archives are also mirrored at the
<a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/releases">GitHub Hamlib releases</a> page.  The most recent release is listed first.

<p><a name="Source-snapshots"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 Getting source snapshots</h4>

<p><a name="index-Getting-source-snapshots-33"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-getting-snapshots-34"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-obtaining-snapshots-35"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-daily-snapshots-36"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-release-candidates-37"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-RC-38"></a>
Testing release candidates (RCs) are posted during the period (often a
few weeks) before a planned release.  Beginning with the 3.2 release,
RCs are hosted by the <a href="https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib/releases">GitHub release archive</a>.  RCs are identifed by having a <i>~rc</i>
suffix.

   <p>Daily snapshots of the development repository are available via the
World Wide Web from <a href="http://n0nb.users.sourceforge.net/">Hamlib Git daily snapshots</a>.  These are not official releases but are
provided for testing new features and bug fixes.

   <p>The daily development snapshot is made and posted each day by around
1030 UTC.  Daily snapshots <i>should</i> compile but sometimes a bug
creeps in that prevents compilation.  If that should happen, please
report it to the <a href="mailto:hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">hamlib-developer mailing list</a>.

<p><a name="Git-clone"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Git repository</h4>

<p><a name="index-Git-repository-39"></a><a name="index-Git-clone-40"></a>
The source repository can be <dfn>cloned</dfn> which copies the repository
to your computer including its entire history, branches, and release
tag information.  In other words, once the <samp><span class="command">git</span></samp>
<samp><span class="option">clone</span></samp> command is finished a complete copy of the Hamlib
development will be on your computer.  You can do quite a lot with
this as nothing is hidden from view since the entire
history of Hamlib is right there all the way from the very first
commit to the present.  None of the meta-data is hidden away on
some central server.

   <p>To clone the repository use the following command:

<pre class="example">     git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/hamlib/code hamlib
</pre>
   <p>or:

<pre class="example">     git clone https://github.com/Hamlib/Hamlib.git
</pre>
   <p>Odds are that you will want to run the above command in a sub
directory of your home directory.  The <samp><span class="file">hamlib</span></samp> directory will be
created by Git and the <dfn>master</dfn> branch will be checked out for you
as the <dfn>working copy</dfn>.  The master branch is one of several
branches used in Hamlib development.  It is the main branch of new
features and bug fixes.  The working copy will be the latest revision
of every file at the time of the clone.  Later updates from the
developers will require using another Git command to update your local
repository.

   <p>See <a href="#Working-with-Git">Working with Git</a>.

<p><a name="Building-from-source"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Building from source</h3>

<p><a name="index-Building-from-source-41"></a><a name="index-Source_002c-building-from-42"></a>
Building from source will be required for various reasons.  Perhaps
only an older release is provided by your distribution, or you would
like to test recent changes to Hamlib&mdash;either a specific back end or
API changes&mdash;and offer a report to the developers, or you'd like to
take part in development and offer your contribution to the project,
or you'd just like to learn how to build a relatively comprehensive
package from source.  Any is a good reason to build from the source
code archive.

   <p>Before going further, this manual assumes familiarity with working
from the command prompt in a Linux/BSD/Unix like system's <dfn>shell</dfn>
environment, either in a <dfn>virtual console</dfn> (a text only screen
with no graphics) or in a <dfn>terminal</dfn> in a desktop environment
(<samp><span class="command">xterm</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rxvt</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">konsole</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">gnome-terminal</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">xfce4-terminal</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">terminal</span></samp>, etc.).  If this is new to you, take some time and
read up on using the shell.  A good tutorial can be found at
<a href="http://linuxcommand.org/">LinuxCommand.org</a> which also offers an
in-depth book that can be purchased or downloaded for no cost (the
Hamlib project is not associated with nor has any interest in the sale
of this book, it just looks like a very good effort on the part of its
author).

   <p>Let's get started.

<p><a name="Compiling-source-tarballs"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Compiling source tarballs</h4>

<p><a name="index-Compiling-source-tarballs-43"></a><a name="index-Source-tarballs_002c-compiling-44"></a>
Before proceeding, it is essential to read the information in the
files, <samp><span class="file">README</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">README.betatester</span></samp>
supplied in the Hamlib <dfn>top-level</dfn> directory which will be named
something like <samp><span class="file">hamlib-3.3~git</span></samp> where the latter part is the
release version.  In this case the `<samp><span class="samp">3.3~git</span></samp>' indicates this is a
development snapshot of the Git master branch.  These files provide
detailed information for compiling Hamlib and will vary some from
release to release.

   <p>Compiling from a source tarball whether it is an official release or a
testing or daily development snapshot follows the same set of
commands, known as the <dfn>three step</dfn> which are each run from the
top-level directory:

<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install
</pre>
   <p><a name="configure"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.1 <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp></h5>

<p><a name="index-configure-45"></a>
The <samp><span class="command">./configure</span></samp> command examines your system and checks it
for any packages that are required or good to have options for
compiling Hamlib.  The leading <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp> tells the shell to only run
the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command found in the current directory.  It is
always possible that a <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command could be lurking
elsewhere and we don't want to run that!

   <p>Run:

<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">./configure</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p>from the top-level directory.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Some distributions are configured so commands can only be run from
directories listed in the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable.  The
<samp><span class="file">./</span></samp> is necessary or the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command will not be
run as the <dfn>current directory</dfn> (defined as <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>) is not in the
<samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>.  This is considered a default security feature so that
only programs provided by the distribution are run.  <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> can be
modified for your own session, but that is a topic for the
LinuxCommand.org reference above. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Of course, things are usually complicated a bit by options and Hamlib
is no exception.  The good news is that the defaults, i.e., no
options, work well in most situations.  Options are needed to enable
the compilation of certain portions of Hamlib such as the language
bindings.  Optional features usually require that more development
tools are installed.  The <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="file">README.betatester</span></samp>
files in the Hamlib top-level directory will have details on the
options available for that release.

   <p>A useful option is `<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>' which tells <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
where in the file system hierarchy Hamlib should be installed.  If it
is not given, Hamlib will be installed in the <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> file
system hierarchy.  Perhaps you want to install to your home directory
instead:

<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">./configure --prefix=$HOME/local</span></samp>
</pre>
   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> For practice you may wish to start out using the
`<samp><span class="samp">--prefix=$HOME/local</span></samp>' option to install the Hamlib files into
your home directory and avoid overwriting any version of Hamlib
installed into the system directories.  The code examples in the
remainder of this manual will assume Hamlib has been installed to
`<samp><span class="samp">$HOME/local</span></samp>'. 
</blockquote>

   <p>All of the files will be installed in the <samp><span class="file">local</span></samp> directory of
your home directory.  <samp><span class="file">local</span></samp> will be created if it does not
exist during installation as will several other directories in it. 
Installing in your home directory means that <dfn>root</dfn>, or superuser
(administrator) privileges are not required when running <samp><span class="command">make
install</span></samp>.  On the other hand, some extra work will need to be done so
other programs can use the library.

   <p>Another useful option is `<samp><span class="samp">--help</span></samp>' which will give a few screens
full of options for <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  If in a desktop environment
the scroll bar can be used to scroll back up through the output.  In
either a terminal or a virtual console Linux supports the
&lt;Shift-PageUp&gt; key combination to scroll back up.  Converesely
&lt;Shift-PageDown&gt; can be used to scroll down toward the end of the
output and the shell prompt (Shift-UpArrow/Shift-DownArrow may also
work to scroll one line at a time).

   <p>After a fair amount of time, depending on your computer, and a lot of
screen output, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will finish its job.  So long as
the few lines previous to the shell prompt don't say &ldquo;error&rdquo; or some
such failure message Hamlib is ready to be compiled.  If there is an
error and all of the required packages listed in
<samp><span class="file">README.betatester</span></samp> have been installed, please ask for help on
the <a href="mailto:hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">hamlib-developer mailing list</a>.

<p><a name="make"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.2 <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp></h5>

<p><a name="index-make-46"></a>
The <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> command is responsible for running the
<dfn>compiler</dfn> which reads the source files and from the instructions
it finds in them writes <dfn>object</dfn> files which are the binary
instructions the <acronym>CPU</acronym> of a computer can execute. 
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> then calls the <dfn>linker</dfn> which puts the object files
together in the correct order to create the Hamlib library files and
its executable programs.

   <p>Run:

<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p>from the top-level directory.

   <p>Any error that causes <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to stop early is cause for a
question to the <a href="mailto:hamlib-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">hamlib-developer mailing list</a>.

   <p>In general <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> will take longer than <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> to
complete its run.  As it is a system command and therefore found in
the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>, prefixing <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> with <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp> will cause a
`<samp><span class="samp">command not found</span></samp>' error from the shell.

<p><a name="make-install"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.3 <samp><span class="command">make install</span></samp></h5>

<p><a name="index-make-install-47"></a>
Assuming that you have not set the installation prefix to your home
directory, root (administrator) privileges will be required to install
Hamlib to the system directories.  Two popular methods exist for
gaining root privileges, <samp><span class="command">su</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="command">sudo</span></samp> is probably the most popular these days, particularly
when using the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> family of
distributions.

   <p>Run:

<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">sudo make install</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p>as root from the top-level directory.

   <p>Running <samp><span class="command">make install</span></samp> will call the installer to put all of
the newly compiled files and other files (such as this document) in
predetermined places set by the `<samp><span class="samp">--prefix</span></samp>' option to
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> in the directory hierarchy (yes, this is by design
and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is not just flinging files any old place!).

   <p>A lot of screen output will be generated.  Any errors will probably be
rather early in the process and will likely be related to your
<var>username</var> not having write permissions in the system directory
structure.

<p><a name="ldconfig"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.4 <samp><span class="command">ldconfig</span></samp></h5>

<p><a name="index-ldconfig-48"></a>
Once the installation is complete one more step is required if Hamlib
has never been installed from a local build before.  The
<samp><span class="command">ldconfig</span></samp> command tells the system library loader where to
find the newly installed Hamlib libraries.  It too will need to be run
with root privileges:

   <p>Run:

<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">sudo ldconfig</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p>as root from any directory.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Subsequent installations of Hamlib will not need to have
<samp><span class="command">ldconfig</span></samp> run after each installation if a newer major
version of Hamlib was not installed, i.e. when recompiling the same
version during development. 
</blockquote>

   <p>On some distributions a bit of configuration will be needed before
<samp><span class="command">ldconfig</span></samp> will add locally compiled software to its database. 
Please consult your distribution's documentation.

<p><a name="Bootstrapping-from-a-Git-clone"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Bootstrapping from a <samp><span class="command">git clone</span></samp></h4>

<p><a name="index-Bootstrapping-from-a-Git-clone-49"></a><a name="index-Git-clone_002c-bootsrapping-50"></a>
Choosing to build from from a <samp><span class="command">git clone</span></samp> requires a few more
development tools (notice a theme here?) as detailed in
<samp><span class="file">README.developer</span></samp>.  The most critical will be the GNU Autotools
(<samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">automake</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">libtool</span></samp>, and more)
from which the build system consisting of <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>, the
various <samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp>s throughout the directory structure, and
the final <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s are generated.

   <p>In the top-level directory is the <samp><span class="command">bootstrap</span></samp> script from
which the build system is <dfn>bootsrapped</dfn>&mdash;the process of
generating the Hamlib build system from <samp><span class="file">configure.ac</span></samp> and the
various <samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp>s.  At its completion the
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script will be present to configure the build
system.

   <p>Next <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> is run with any needed build options
(<samp><span class="command">configure --help</span></samp> is useful) to enable certain features or
provide paths for locating needed build dependencies, etc. 
Environment variables intended for the preprocessor and/or compiler
may also be set on the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command line.

   <p>After the configuration is complete, the build may proceed with the
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> step as for the source tarballs above.  Or
<samp><span class="command">configure --help</span></samp> may be run, and <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> run
again with specific options in which case the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s will be
regenerated and the build can proceed with the new configuration.

   <p>See <a href="#configure">configure</a>.

<p><a name="Other-make-targets"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 Other <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> targets</h4>

<p><a name="index-Other-_0040command_007bmake_007d-targets-51"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007bmake_007d_002c-other-targets-52"></a>
Besides <samp><span class="command">make install</span></samp>, other <dfn>targets</dfn> exist when running
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.  Running <samp><span class="command">make clean</span></samp> from the top-level
directory removes all of the generated object and executable files
generated by running <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> freeing up considerable disk
space.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> During development of individual source files, it is not necessary to
run <samp><span class="command">make clean</span></samp> each time before <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>.  Simply run
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> and only the modified file(s) and any objects that
depend on them will be recompiled.  This speeds up development time
considerably. 
</blockquote>

   <p>To remove even the generated <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s, run <samp><span class="command">make
distclean</span></samp> from the top-level directory.  After this target is run,
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will need to be run again to regenerate the
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s.  This command may not be as useful as the
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s do not take up much space, however it can be useful
for rebuilding the <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s when modifying a
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.am</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">confgure.ac</span></samp> during build system
development.

<p><a name="Parallel-build-trees"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Parallel build trees</h4>

<p><a name="index-Parallel-build-trees-53"></a><a name="index-Build_002c-parallel-trees-54"></a>
One feature of the GNU build system used by Hamlib is that the object
files can be kept in a directory structure separate from the source
files.  While this has no effect on the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> targets
described above, it does help the developer find files in the source
tree!  One such way of using parallel builds is described in
<samp><span class="file">README.developer</span></samp>.

   <p>Parallel builds can be very useful as one build directory can be
configured for a release and another build directory can be configured
for debugging with different options passed to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
from each directory.  The generated <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>s are unique to
each build directory and will not interfere with each other.

<p><a name="Adding-debugging-symbols"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.5 Adding debugging symbols</h4>

<p><a name="index-Adding-debugging-symbols-55"></a>
When additional debugging symbols are needed with, for example, the
GNU Debugger, <samp><span class="command">gdb</span></samp>, the needed compiler and linker options
are passed as environment variables.

   <p>Run:
<pre class="example">     <samp><span class="command">../hamlib/configure CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0" CXXFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0"</span></samp>
</pre>
   <p>from a sibling build directory intended for a debugging build.

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">-ggdb3</span></samp>' option tells the C compiler, this case the GNU C
Compiler, <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, to add special symbols useful for GDB, the
GNU debugger.  The `<samp><span class="samp">-O0</span></samp>' option tells <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> to turn off
all optimizations which will make it easier to follow some variables
that might otherwise be optimized away.  `<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>' and
`<samp><span class="samp">CXXFLAGS</span></samp>' may be set independently for each compiler.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> There are a number compiler options available for controlling debugging
symbols and setting optimization levels.  Please consult the compiler's
manual for all the details.

<p><a name="Utility-programs"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">3 Utility programs reference</h2>

<p>Included with the Hamlib distribution are several utility programs. 
Besides providing a way for developers to test new code and bug fixes,
the programs also offer a reference implementation for interfacing to
the Hamlib library functions both through the C API (Application
Programming Interface) and offering a network accessible API.

   <p>This chapter focuses on the two test programs, <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> for
testing radio back ends and <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> for testing rotator back
ends and the two network daemons, <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">rotcltd</span></samp> for radio and rotator access via network sockets. 
Also included are three demonstation utilities, <samp><span class="command">rigmem</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">rigsmtr</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="command">rigswr</span></samp> which provide functional
examples of how Hamlib may be used to accomplish various tasks.

<p><a name="rigctl"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.1 <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp></h3>

<p><a name="index-rigctl-61"></a>
<samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> is the most frequently used Hamlib utility.  As the
other ctl utilities share many of the same characteristics, much of
the introductory information presented in this section is applicable
to the other utility programs.

<p><a name="Introduction-to-rigctl"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Introduction to <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp></h4>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-to-_0040command_007brigctl_007d-62"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007brigctl_007d_002c-introduction-to-63"></a>
Most likely the first of the Hamlib utility programs that is used is
<samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp>.  <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> is a character based interactive
program and a command line program able to set or query a radio's
value with a single command.  <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> is invoked from a shell
command prompt with various options and additional commands.

   <p>In its most simple use as a <dfn>command line</dfn> program,
<samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> is used to set frequency and mode by typing commands
after any <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> options:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rigctl F 14205000</kbd>
     <kbd>rigctl M USB 2400</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then query those values:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rigctl f</kbd>
     <kbd>rigctl m</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Entering interactive mode is a simple matter of not placing any
commands after any <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> options:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rigctl</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Entering <dfn>interactive mode</dfn> allows successive commands to be
entered without exiting <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp>.  Recent additions to
<samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> allow command editing and history recall through use
of the <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">Readline</a> library.

   <p>Interactive mode is indicated by the spartan prompt:

<pre class="example">     Rig command:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Commands are given at the prompt and follow the general rule that
upper case letters set a value and lower case letters query a value:

<pre class="example">     Rig command: <kbd>M</kbd>
     Mode: <kbd>USB</kbd>
     Passband: <kbd>2500</kbd>
     
     Rig command: <kbd>m</kbd>
     Mode: USB
     Passband: 2500
     
     Rig command:
</pre>
   <p>An additional prompt is printed when more information is required by
the command.  For <kbd>M</kbd> above, <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> prompted for the
&ldquo;Mode&rdquo; and &ldquo;Passband&rdquo; values.  For <kbd>m</kbd> above, <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp>
returned the &ldquo;Mode&rdquo; and &ldquo;Passband&rdquo; values without further prompts. 
The command prompt is returned after each command invocation.

   <p>The above examples invoked <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp> without specifying a radio
model.  This is a feature where the Hamlib internal radio <dfn>dummy</dfn> is
used instead.  The dummy radio provides a way to test Hamlib functions
with out the need for actual radio hardware.  However, to develop back
end capability for a given radio, having the actual radio connected to
the computer is necessary for debugging.

   <p>For example, to quickly set frequency on an Elecraft K3:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rigctl -m 229 -r /dev/rig F 3900000</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and to query the frequency and then mode:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rigctl -m 229 -r /dev/rig f</kbd>
     3900000
     
     <kbd>rigctl -m 229 -r /dev/rig m</kbd>
     LSB
     2000
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The returned values do not have the prompt strings associated with
interactive mode as shown above.

   <p>The <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> option takes a numeric value that corresponds to a
given radio back end model.  The <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option takes the path to
the port device on <acronym>POSIX</acronym> and the device name on Microsoft
Windows.

Identical in function to <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> provides a
means for testing Hamlib functions useful for rotator control and
<acronym>QTH</acronym> (Maidenhead gridsquare system, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System">Maidenhead Locator System</a>) locator computations.  As rotators have a
much narrower scope than radios, there are fewer command line options
and commands for <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Introduction to <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp></h4>

<p><a name="index-Introduction-to-_0040command_007brotctl_007d-67"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040command_007brotctl_007d_002c-introduction-to-68"></a>
<samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> is a character based interactive program and a
command line program able to set or query a rotator's value with a
single command.  <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> is invoked from a shell command
prompt with various options and additional commands.

   <p>In its most simple use as a command line program, <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> is
used to set frequency and mode by typing commands after any
<samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> options:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rotctl P 145.0 23.0</kbd>
     <kbd>rotctl M 8 25</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and then query those values:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rotctl p</kbd>
</pre>
   <p>Entering interactive mode is a simple matter of not placing any
commands after any <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> options:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rotctl</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Entering interactive mode allows successive commands to be entered
without exiting <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp>.  Interactive mode allows for command
editing and history recall through the use of the <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">Readline</a>
library.

   <p>Interactive mode is indicated by the spartan prompt:

<pre class="example">     Rotator command:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Commands are given at the prompt:

<pre class="example">     Rotator command: <kbd>M</kbd>
     Direction: 16
     Speed: 60
     
     Rotator command: <kbd>p</kbd>
     Azimuth: 11.352000
     Elevation: 0.000000
     
     Rotator command: <kbd>p</kbd>
     Azimuth: 27.594000
     Elevation: 0.000000
     
     Rotator command:
</pre>
   <p>An additional prompt is printed when more information is required by
the command.  For <kbd>M</kbd> above, <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> prompted for the
&ldquo;Direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; values.  For <kbd>p</kbd> above,
<samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> returned the &ldquo;Azimuth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elevation&rdquo; values
without further prompts.  The command prompt is returned after each
command invocation.

   <p>The above examples invoked <samp><span class="command">rotctl</span></samp> without specifying a
rotator model.  This is a feature where the Hamlib internal rotator
dummy is used instead.  The dummy rotator provides a way to test
Hamlib functions with out the need for actual rotator hardware. 
However, to develop back end capability for a given rotator, having
the actual controller connected to the computer is necessary for
debugging.

   <p>For example, to quickly set position for RotorEZ:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rotctl -m 401 -r /dev/rotor P 100.0 0.0</kbd>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and to query the position:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>rotctl -m 401 -r /dev/rotor p</kbd>
     100.000000
     0.000000
     
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The returned values do not have the prompt strings associated with
interactive mode as shown above.

   <p>The <samp><span class="option">-m</span></samp> option takes a numeric value that corresponds to a
given rotator back end model.  The <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option takes the path to
the port device on <acronym>POSIX</acronym> or the device name on MS Windows.

The <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> program is a network server that accepts the

<samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> communicates to a client through a <acronym>TCP</acronym>
network socket using text commands shared with <samp><span class="command">rigctl</span></samp>. The
protocol is simple; commands are sent to <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> on one line
and <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> responds to &ldquo;get&rdquo; commands with the requested
values, one per line, when successful, otherwise, it responds with one
line `<samp><span class="samp">RPRT x</span></samp>', where `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' is a negative number indicating the
Hamlib error code.  Commands that do not return values respond with
the line `<samp><span class="samp">RPRT x</span></samp>', where `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' is zero when successful,
otherwise a negative number indicating the Hamlib error code.  Each
line is terminated with a newline <code>\n</code> character.  This protocol
is primarily for use by the <code>NET rigctl</code> (radio model 2) backend.

   <p>A separate Extended Response protocol extends the above behavior by
echoing the received command string as a header, any returned values
as a key: value pair, and the `<samp><span class="samp">RPRT x</span></samp>' string as the end of
response marker which includes the Hamlib success or failure value. 
Consider using this protocol for clients that will interact with
<samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> directly through a <acronym>TCP</acronym> network socket.

   <p>Multiple radios can be controlled on different <acronym>TCP</acronym> ports by
use of multiple <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> processes each listening on a unique
<acronym>TCP</acronym> port. It is hoped that <samp><span class="command">rigctld</span></samp> will be

<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

     <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

     <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

     <li>RELICENSING

     <p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.

     <p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

     <p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.

     <p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

     <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

        </ol>

<h3 class="heading">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with<small class="dots">...</small>Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
